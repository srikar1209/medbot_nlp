Medical Symptom Analysis and Diagnosis:
This project aims to develop a system for analyzing medical symptoms and providing potential disease diagnoses based on a given set of symptoms. The project utilizes natural language processing techniques, machine learning, and data analysis to process medical datasets and perform symptom-disease mapping.


Features:
Preprocess and clean medical symptom data

Extract symptoms and diseases from the dataset

Perform syntactic and semantic similarity analysis between symptoms

Suggest synonyms for input symptoms

Calculate one-hot vector representations of symptoms

Identify possible diseases based on the provided set of symptoms




Requirements:
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

spaCy

WordNet



Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-symptom-analysis.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the necessary NLTK data:

pythonCopy codeimport nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')


Usage:

1.Ensure that the Medical_dataset directory containing the Training.csv and Testing.csv files is present in the project directory.

2.Run the Python script:

python main.py

3.Follow the prompts to input the symptoms or use the provided functions to perform various operations, such as:

Preprocessing and cleaning symptoms

Calculating syntactic and semantic similarity between symptoms

Suggesting synonyms for input symptoms

Generating one-hot vector representations of symptoms

Identifying possible diseases based on the provided set of symptoms
